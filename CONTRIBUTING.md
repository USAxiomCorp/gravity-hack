- Why you changed it
- Any relevant physics/engineering justification

## Code Style

- **Python:** Follow PEP 8
- **Comments:** Explain the physics, not just the code
- **Documentation:** Update README if you add features
- **Tests:** Add tests for new functionality

## Physics Contributions

If you have **theoretical improvements**:
1. Open an issue describing the physics
2. Include mathematical derivation
3. Cite relevant papers
4. Discuss implications

If you find **physics errors**:
1. Open an issue with specific details
2. Show your calculation
3. Suggest corrections
4. Be respectful (we're all learning)

## Experimental Work
