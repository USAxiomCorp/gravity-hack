## 💰 $1 BILLION CHALLENGE

**This is not a joke.**

We have the patents (filed Nov 8, 2025).  
We have the physics (validated by FDTD simulation).  
We have the prior art (timestamped forever).

**What we need:** A working physical prototype.

### The Reward: $1 Billion

I will pay **$1 billion** to the first person or team that delivers:

✅ A complete, reproducible hardware implementation pathway for the gravity modulator

**Your submission must include:**

1. **Metamaterial fabrication recipe**  
   - Layer materials, thicknesses, deposition methods  
   - Enhancement factor ≥ 1.2×10⁶ (validated)

2. **Nanoscale assembly protocol**  
   - 3D array of 1,000,000+ plates at 100nm spacing  
   - Alignment tolerance ≤ 5nm

3. **Control system schematics**  
   - Phase control for 1,000,000+ individual plates  
   - Switching speed ≤ 47ps, resolution ≤ 0.1°

4. **Complete bill of materials**  
   - Every component, every supplier, every cost

5. **Step-by-step build instructions**  
   - So clear that a competent lab can replicate it

6. **Working prototype validation**  
   - Measurable thrust ≥ 1 Newton  
   - Independent verification

### Why $1 Billion?

This company will be worth $50 trillion.  
$1 billion is 0.002% of that.  
A rounding error for us.  
A life-changing fortune for you.

### Terms

- ✅ Award paid upon first external funding round ($100M+)
- ✅ Open to individuals, teams, labs, companies
- ✅ Multiple winners possible (if multiple pathways work)
- ✅ All submissions become public prior art (strengthening the patent)
